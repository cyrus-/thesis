# Reasonably Programmable Syntax

This repository contains my PhD dissertation.

## Build instructions

Assuming Debian/Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt install texlive-full texlive-pstricks
$ make
```

## Notes

The macros.tex file defines the macros I use. Many of the macro names in there, and various section and figure labels, are inconsistent with the terms in the text because those terms evolved over time and I was too lazy to fix macro names.
