# Reasonably Programmable Syntax

This repository contains my PhD dissertation. The final PDF is available from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~comar/omar-thesis.pdf.

## Build instructions

Assuming Debian/Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt install texlive-full texlive-pstricks
$ make
```

## Notes

The macros.tex file defines the macros I use. Many of the macro names in there, as well as various section and figure labels, are inconsistent with the terms in the text because those terms evolved over time and I neglected to fix things. If you're going to actually write something using my TeX macros, let me know and I'd be happy to do a clean-up pass.
