# Reasonably Programmable Syntax

This repository contains my PhD dissertation.

## Build instructions

Assuming Debian/Ubuntu

```
$ sudo apt install texlive-full texlive-pstricks
$ make
```

## Bibliography

Currently, I use the research.bib file from my "papers" repository. When I'm done, I'll archive the final .bib file here so that compilation is reproducible.

## Notes

The macros.tex file defines the macros I use. Many of the macro names in there are inconsistent with the terms in the text because those terms evolved over time and I was too lazy to fix macro names. Hopefully I'll have time to do a pass over those at some point.
