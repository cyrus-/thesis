\section{Future Directions}
\subsection{Mechanically Verifying TSM Definitions}\label{sec:verifying-tsms}
Finally, VerseML is not designed for advanced theorem proving tasks where languages like Coq, Agda or Idris might be used today. That said, we conjecture that the primitives we describe could be integrated into languages like Gallina (the ``external language'' of the Coq proof assistant  \cite{Coq:manual}) with  modifications, but do not plan to pursue this line of research here.

In such a setting, you could verify TSM definitions \todo{finish writing this}
\subsection{Improved Error Reporting}\label{sec:error-handling}
\subsection{Type-Aware Splicing}\label{sec:type-aware-splicing}
\subsection{Integration With Code Editors}\label{sec:interaction-with-tools}

\todo{Cite recent work at PLDI (?) and ICFP from Brown}
\subsection{Non-Textual Display Forms}\label{sec:non-textual-display-forms}
\todo{Talk about active code completion work and future ideas}
