  abstract =	"Large software projects consist of code written in a
		 multitude of different (possibly domain-specific)
		 languages, which are often deeply interspersed even in
		 single files. While many proposals exist on how to
		 integrate languages semantically and syntactically, the
		 question of how to support this scenario in integrated
		 development environments (IDEs) remains open: How can
		 standard IDE services, such as syntax highlighting,
		 outlining, or reference resolving, be provided in an
		 extensible and compositional way, such that an open mix
		 of languages is supported in a single file? Based on
		 our library-based syntactic extension language for
		 Java, SugarJ, we propose to make IDEs extensible by
		 organizing editor services in editor libraries. Editor
		 libraries are libraries written in the object language,
		 SugarJ, and hence activated and composed through
		 regular import statements on a file-by-file basis. We
		 have implemented an IDE for editor libraries on top of
		 SugarJ and the Eclipse-based Spoofax language
		 workbench. We have validated editor libraries by
		 evolving this IDE into a fully-fledged and schema-aware
		 XML editor as well as an extensible Latex editor, which
		 we used for writing this paper.",

@article{Kilpatrick:2014:BRH,
	Abstract = {Module systems like that of Haskell permit only a weak
		 form of modularity in which module implementations
		 depend directly on other implementations and must be
		 processed in dependency order. Module systems like that
		 of ML, on the other hand, permit a stronger form of
		 modularity in which explicit interfaces express
		 assumptions about dependencies, and each module can be
		 typechecked and reasoned about independently. In this
		 paper, we present Backpack, a new language for building
		 separately-typecheckable *packages* on top of a weak
		 module system like Haskell's. The design of Backpack is
		 inspired by the MixML module calculus of Rossberg and
		 Dreyer, but differs significantly in detail. Like
		 MixML, Backpack supports explicit interfaces and
		 recursive linking. Unlike MixML, Backpack supports a
		 more flexible applicative semantics of instantiation.
		 Moreover, its design is motivated less by foundational
		 concerns and more by the practical concern of
		 integration into Haskell, which has led us to advocate
		 simplicity --- in both the syntax and semantics of
		 Backpack --- over raw expressive power. The semantics
		 of Backpack packages is defined by elaboration to sets
		 of Haskell modules and binary interface files, thus
		 showing how Backpack maintains interoperability with
		 Haskell while extending it with separate typechecking.
		 Lastly, although Backpack is geared toward integration
		 into Haskell, its design and semantics are largely
		 agnostic with respect to the details of the underlying
		 core language.},

	Abstract = {
We present Alice, a functional programming language that has been designed with strong support for <I>typed open programming</i>. It incorporates concurrency with data flow synchronisation, higher-order modularity, dynamic modules, and type-safe pickling as a minimal and generic set of simple, orthogonal features providing that support. Based on these mechanisms Alice offers a flexible notion of component, and high-level facilities for distributed programming.

@article{Rompf:2012:LMS,
	Abstract = {Good software engineering practice demands
		 generalization and abstraction, whereas high
		 performance demands specialization and concretization.
		 These goals are at odds, and compilers can only rarely
		 translate expressive high-level programs to modern
		 hardware platforms in a way that makes best use of the
		 available resources. Generative programming is a
		 promising alternative to fully automatic translation.
		 Instead of writing down the target program directly,
		 developers write a program generator, which produces
		 the target program as its output. The generator can be
		 written in a high-level, generic style and can still
		 produce efficient, specialized target programs. In
		 practice, however, developing high-quality program
		 generators requires a very large effort that is often
		 hard to amortize. We present lightweight modular
		 staging (LMS), a generative programming approach that
		 lowers this effort significantly. LMS seamlessly
		 combines program generator logic with the generated
		 code in a single program, using only types to
		 distinguish the two stages of execution. Through
		 extensive use of component technology, LMS makes a
		 reusable and extensible compiler framework available at
		 the library level, allowing programmers to tightly
		 integrate domain-specific abstractions and
		 optimizations into the generation process, with common
		 generic optimizations provided by the framework. LMS is
		 well suited to develop embedded domain-specific
		 languages (DSLs) and has been used to develop powerful
		 performance-oriented DSLs for demanding domains such as
		 machine learning, with code generation for
		 heterogeneous platforms including GPUs. LMS has also
		 been used to generate SQL for embedded database queries
		 and JavaScript for web applications.},

	Abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the implementation of
		 NESL, a portable nested data-parallel language. This
		 language and its implementation are the first to fully
		 support nested data structures as well as nested
		 data-parallel function calls. These features allow the
		 concise description of parallel algorithms on irregular
		 data, such as sparse matrices and graphs. In addition,
		 they maintain the advantages of data-parallel
		 languages: a simple programming model and portability.
		 The current NESL implementation is based on an
		 intermediate language called VCODE and a library of
		 vectore routines called CVL. It runs on the Connection
		 Machine CM-2, the Cray Y-MP C90, and serial machines.
		 We compare initial benchmark results of NESL with those
		 of machine-specific code on these machines for three
		 algorithms: least-squares line-fitting, median finding,
		 and a sparse-matrix vector product. These results show
		 that NESL's performance is competitive with that of
		 machine-specific codes for regular dense data, and is
		 often superior for irregular data.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  As large-scale, detailed network modeling projects are flourishing in the field of computational neuroscience, it is more
and more important to design single neuron models that not only capture qualitative features of real neurons but are quantitatively
accurate in silico representations of those. Recent years have seen substantial effort being put in the development of algorithms
for the systematic evaluation and optimization of neuron models with respect to electrophysiological data. It is however difficult
to compare these methods because of the lack of appropriate benchmark tests. Here, we describe one such effort of providing
the community with a standardized set of tests to quantify the performances of single neuron models. Our effort takes the
form of a yearly challenge similar to the ones which have been present in the machine learning community for some time. This
paper gives an account of the first two challenges which took place in 2007 and 2008 and discusses future directions. The
results of the competition suggest that best performance on data obtained from single or double electrode current or conductance
injection is achieved by models that combine features of standard leaky integrate-and-fire models with a second variable reflecting
adaptation, refractoriness, or a dynamic threshold.},

	Abstract = {Class names represent the concepts implemented in object-oriented source code and are key elements in program comprehension and, thus, software maintenance. Programming conventions often state that class names should be noun-phrases, but there is little further guidance for developers on the composition of class names. Other researchers have observed that the majority of Java class identifier names are composed of one or more nouns preceded, optionally, by one or more adjectives. However, no detailed analysis of class identifier name structure has been undertaken that could be leveraged to support program comprehension activities.
We investigate the lexical and syntactic composition of Java class identifier names in two ways. Firstly, as others have done for C function and Java method names, we identify conventional patterns found in the use of parts of speech. Secondly, we identify the origin of words used in class names within the name of any super class and implemented interfaces to identify patterns of class name construction related to inheritance.
Through the analysis of 120,000 unique class names found in 60 open source projects we identify both common and project specific class naming conventions. We apply this knowledge in a case study of the mind-mapping tool Freemind to investigate whether class names that follow unconventional naming schemes are candidates for refactoring ? either a name refactoring that conforms to established naming conventions within the code base, or refactoring of the class that results in conventionally named classes.},

	Abstract = {Object-oriented frameworks are often difficult to use. Framework- specific extensions to integrated development environments (IDEs) aim to mitigate the difficulty by offering tools that leverage the knowledge about framework{\textquoteright}s application programming interfaces (APIs). These tools commonly offer support for code visualization, automatic and interactive code generation, and code validation. Current practices, however, require such extensions to be custom-built manually for each supported framework. In this paper, we propose an approach to building framework-specific IDE extensions based on framework-specific modeling languages (FSMLs). We show how the definitions of different FSMLs can be interpreted in these extensions to provide advanced tool support for different framework APIs that the FSMLs are designed for.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in programming environments have
		 focused on improving programmer productivity by
		 utilizing the inherent structure in computer programs.
		 However, because these environments represent code as
		 plain text, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to
		 embed interactive tools, annotations, and alternative
		 views in the code itself. Barista is an implementation
		 framework that enables the creation of such user
		 interfaces by simplifying the implementation of editors
		 that represent code internally as an abstract syntax
		 tree and maintain a corresponding, fully structured
		 visual representation on-screen. Barista also provides
		 designers of editors with a standard text-editing
		 interaction technique that closely mimics that of
		 conventional text editors, overcoming a central
		 usability issue of previous structured code editors.},

	Abstract = {Code completion is a widely used productivity tool. It takes away the burden of remembering and typing the exact names of methods or classes: As a developer starts typing a name, it provides a progressively refined list of candidates matching the name. However, the candidate list always comes in alphabetic order, i.e., the environment is only second-guessing the name based on pattern matching. Finding the correct candidate can be cumbersome or slower than typing the full name. We present an approach to improve code completion with program history. We define a benchmark measuring the accuracy and usefulness of a code completion engine. Further, we use the change history data to also improve the results offered by code completion tools. Finally, we propose an alternative interface for completion tools.},

As a result, often proposals are made which are irrelevant for a particular working context. Also, these suggestions are ordered alphabetically rather than by their relevance in a particular context. In this paper, we present intelligent code completion systems that learn from existing code repositories. We have implemented three such systems, each using the information contained in repositories in a different way. We perform a large-scale quantitative evaluation of these systems, integrate the best performing one into Eclipse, and evaluate the latter also by a user study. Our experiments give evidence that intelligent code completion systems which learn from examples significantly outperform mainstream code completion systems in terms of the relevance of their suggestions and thus have the potential to enhance developers' productivity.},

@inproceedings{mehta_robust_2007,
	Abstract = {The widespread deployment of recommender systems has lead to user feedback of varying quality. While some users faithfully express their true opinion, many provide noisy ratings which can be detrimental to the quality of the generated recommendations. The presence of noise can violate modeling assumptions and may thus lead to instabilities in estimation and prediction. Even worse, malicious users can deliberately insert attack profiles in an attempt to bias the recommender system to their benefit. Robust statistics is an area within statistics where estimation methods have been developed that deteriorate more gracefully in the presence of unmodeled noise and slight departures from modeling assumptions. In this work, we study how such robust statistical methods, in particular M-estimators, can be used to generate stable recommendation even in the presence of noise and spam. To that extent, we present a Robust Matrix Factorization algorithm and study its stability. We conclude that M-estimators do not add significant stability to recommendation; however the presented algorithm can outperform existing recommendation algorithms in its recommendation quality.},

A user study comparing the usability of the factory pattern and constructors in {API} designs found highly significant results indicating that factories are detrimental to {API} usability in several varied situations. The results showed that users require significantly more time (p = 0.005) to construct an object with a factory than with a constructor while performing both context-sensitive and context- free tasks. These results suggest that the use of factories can and should be avoided in many cases where other techniques, such as constructors or class clusters, can be used instead.},

	Abstract = {Over the past decade, I have performed several field
		 studies with scientists developing software either on
		 their own or together with software engineers. Based on
		 these field study data, I identify a model of
		 scientific software development as practiced in many
		 scientific laboratories and communities. This model
		 does not fit the standard software engineering models.
		 For example, the tasks of requirement elicitation and
		 software evaluation are not clearly delineated.
		 Nevertheless, it appears to be successful within the
		 context in which it is used. In the context in which
		 scientists collaborate with software engineers,
		 however, I describe problems which arose from the clash
		 of this model with a traditional,phased software
		 engineering model. Given these models, I discuss the
		 issues which have to be addressed in order to determine
		 the software techniques and tools which might best
		 support scientific software development in different
		 contexts.},

@article{Leroy-Compcert-CACM,
	Abstract = {This paper reports on the development and formal verification (proof
of semantic preservation) of CompCert, a compiler from Clight (a
large subset of the C programming language) to PowerPC assembly code,
using the Coq proof assistant both for programming the compiler and
for proving its correctness.  Such a verified compiler is useful in
the context of critical software and its formal verification: the
verification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as
well.},
